# Setup Instructions

## Receiving updates

To be done once: add our project repo as an extra remote called `upstream`.

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/distributed-applications-bitcoin.git
```

To be done at each update:

```bash
$ git pull upstream master
```

To be notified of updates, register as watcher [here](https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/distributed-applications-bitcoin).
